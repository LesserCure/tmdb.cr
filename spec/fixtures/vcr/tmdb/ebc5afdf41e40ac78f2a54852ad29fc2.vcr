Despite carving out new lives for themselves—Aly has found refuge in religion, Viv is a queer artist, and Dmitri is a charismatic schemer—each is in the midst of their crisis. Their attempts at reconciliation are complicated further when Fyodor is murdered and they must finally face the truth about their dark past. Part murder mystery, part spiritual quest, The Karamazovs follows Liz, who pieces together memories of that eventful week.","poster_path":"/6VMqJMYGOIppMLh2ECO7chE20Bj.jpg","media_type":"movie","original_language":"en","genre_ids":[18,35,53],"popularity":0.5756,"release_date":"2024-02-16","video":false,"vote_average":1.0,"vote_count":1},{"adult":false,"backdrop_path":null,"id":424728,"title":"Bratři Karamazovi","original_title":"Bratři Karamazovi","overview":"In 1976, the Czech New Wave philosopher and director Evald Schorm came to the Na zábradlí Theatre. He stayed there for twelve years, until his death. He raised a generation of actors who were aware of their own personalities. In The Brothers Karamazov, the then compact acting ensemble performed in full force on stage. Schorm created from ban to ban (Hamlet, Macbeth, The Brothers Karamazov, Marathon) and in front of Zábradlí, there were queues for tickets in double rows all the way to the Vltava embankment: when the subscription began, people slept outside from midnight until ten in the morning, when the box office opened, in sleeping bags, they brought fishing chairs to the theater. A ticket to Zábradlí was more valuable than Tuzex vouchers...","poster_path":null,"media_type":"movie","original_language":"cs","genre_ids":[18],"popularity":0.3423,"release_date":"1981-01-01","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0},{"adult":false,"backdrop_path":null,"id":198442,"title":"Anna Karamazoff","original_title":"Anna Karamazoff","overview":"This film is of interest primarily because it contains within it the entire surviving footage of an unfinished 1974 film by the same director, Slave of Love, which was successfully remade shortly thereafter by another director, Nikita Mikhalkov.The \"cover\" story is about a woman (Jeanne Moreau) newly released from prison camps in the 1940s back into Russian society, who finds that there is no place for her in the world she has come back to.
