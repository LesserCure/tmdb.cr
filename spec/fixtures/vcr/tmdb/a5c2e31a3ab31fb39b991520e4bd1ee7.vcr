Nobody goes home. Nobody else comes through. It's just him - and me.\r\n\r\nIt's funny really, writing a review for The Terminator these days just feels a little pointless, I mean anyone who wanted to see it would have done so already. In truth the effects work is a little creaky now but that doesn't matter, they were awesome in 1984. It's a ripper of a story awash with high energy action, rip-snorting characterisations and tech-noir atmospherics. It's place in the pantheon of science fiction films is assured, its influence on the genre undoubted, while the lead cast members cemented themselves in the sci-fi hall of fame.\r\n\r\nNo more needs to be said really, The Terminator is a kinetic live action comic book of a movie, classy movie making, paced to precision and featuring a story that's brilliantly complex and utterly compelling. 9/10","created_at":"2015-05-07T21:27:16.743Z","id":"554bd8b4c3a3685e5000296d","updated_at":"2016-03-31T23:06:54.241Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/554bd8b4c3a3685e5000296d"},{"author":"Jodie","author_details":{"name":"Jodie","username":"OhJodieBaby","avatar_path":"/gffJS6L5hb7OrZnD2K6qpurx2sG.jpg","rating":10.0},"content":"Writing a review for a movie this old does indeed seem pointless, but since this is one of my favorite films I thought I would review it anyway. \r\n\r\nIn my opinion The Terminator is a beautiful, yet tragic love story set in the back drop of the future and the past. A soldier from the future is sent to the 80's to save the leader of the resistance (John Connor) mother from a High Tech Cybernetic Killing Machine. We all know that. What I loved was that this soldier, Kyle Reese volunteers for this suicide mission. He volunteers for one reason because, he had fallen in love with this woman, Sarah Connor. Though they were separated by several decades of time and Judgement Day, her son tells him these tales of his mother Sarah and gives him a single picture of her, purposefully pushing Reese to fall for his mother and this is the reason for him traveling through time to do the nearly impossible. Save and protect Sarah Connor to save the human race in the future and kill a super bad ass T-800 with low tech weaponry and a reluctant Damsel.\r\n\r\nBullets flying and bombs booming make this movie highly entertaining. The storyline, ridiculous as it is, is fantastic and had everyone in the 80's and 90's quoting this SciFi film. It's always a good watch. It holds up nicely overtime.","created_at":"2017-02-18T13:49:12.341Z","id":"58a850d8925141565d009293","updated_at":"2017-02-18T14:27:13.508Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/58a850d8925141565d009293"},{"author":"Gimly","author_details":{"name":"Gimly","username":"Ruuz","avatar_path":"/xUObnJSvHrFPsIpoDmb1jiQZLq7.jpg","rating":9.0},"content":"I know saying this puts me in the minority, but the first _Terminator_ movie is actually my favourite of the franchise. That's not a knock on the second movie, _Judgment Day_ is **awesome**. But I really dig the lower down, dark, sci-fi horror vibe of the original (it **is** a knock on every movie in the series that came after _T2_ though).\r\n\r\nSchwarzenegger as the titular Terminator is inspired casting. Firstly, any restrictions he had in acting ability back in the 80s are brushed aside by the fact that he's playing a cold, unfeeling machine. And can you imagine someone who looks like that coming after you? Forget the fact he's got an arsenal in his back pocket, forget the fact that he's got a near unstoppable metal exoskeleton, Arnie is already a machine! Being hunted by that man would be terrifying, and you feel that in the performance of the leads.\r\n\r\n_The Terminator_ is one of the best movies I've ever seen, and I have seen - a lot.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:★★★★½ - Ridiculously strong appeal. I can’t stop thinking about it._","created_at":"2018-03-19T06:19:47.489Z","id":"5aaf56830e0a265e1f01fdb7","updated_at":"2018-03-19T21:56:39.996Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/5aaf56830e0a265e1f01fdb7"},{"author":"Kamurai","author_details":{"name":"Kamurai","username":"Kamurai","avatar_path":"/sKeC7qZLAKreuwxH4x6U3mN7Aa8.jpg","rating":6.0},"content":"Good watch, might watch again, and can recommend.\r\n\r\nI have no idea what just happened, I just watched the 2020 version, and it doesn't even look better, and there doesn't seem be a lot of info on the situation.\r\n\r\nIt has decent practical effects, it's a got plenty of action in a machine chasing a woman aided by a soldier from the future.\r\n\r\nArnold carries an odd amount of weight as an emotionless cyborg, but Linda Hamilton shores up the rest.  I don't think it is Michael Biehn's fault, but Kyle Reese is kind of a forgettable character in this.\r\n\r\nThe depth of this action movie is just on the concept of time travel, and whether or not you can truly change the future.\r\n\r\nThis is a good movie, but it lacks something really special for the time of 2020, it's more important as a precursor to the sequel.","created_at":"2020-07-29T01:19:00.568Z","id":"5f20ce845b2f4700364b2000","updated_at":"2020-08-04T15:38:44.082Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/5f20ce845b2f4700364b2000"}],"total_pages":1,"total_results":4}
